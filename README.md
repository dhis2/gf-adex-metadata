# Global Fund Aggregate Data Exchange (ADEx) metadata

## Introduction

This repository contains DHIS2 metadata for version 39 or higher for the Global Fund ADEx project. Please consult
the documentation for detailed instructions of how to install and configure this metadata.

In order to get started, just import the JSON file located
in the `exchange_indicators` folder. Be sure to import this
into a development instance first! "Atomic mode" in the
Import/Export app must be set to "Import", since
certain references may not exist in your instance.
